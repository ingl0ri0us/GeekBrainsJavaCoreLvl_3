The Internet of Things
Internet 2.0
I remember fondly when I first encountered the internet at the ripe age of eight and thinking it was the best thing on earth. I was able to download music at blazing 56 kb/second speed, read about my favorite video games on GameFAQs.com and chat with my friends/random strangers on Aim Messenger. It was truly a brand new world.
Twenty years later, the internet is still pretty awesome. Many things have changed since then; it is no longer a nice thing to have, but rather a necessity in our everyday lives. The internet is a digital fabric that is woven into our very existence. It allows us to connect with people from all over the world, to speak, hear and communicate with each other in every way imaginable.
A new wave of innovation has risen in the last five years that is changing the digital landscape. Where the internet used to connect people, now it connects things. What things, you ask? All kinds of things from everyday things, like electronics and gadgets, to bigger things homes and even cities.
Thus, the internet of things is born.
