Smart Everything
Whether or not you are behind the idea of everything being connected to the internet, there is no question that the IoT has permeated our lives. Here are some examples of how some of this powerful technology is being used.
Perhaps you own a smart TV that records your favorite shows and has it ready for you when you get home.
Or your house has a smart thermostat that can tell you the temperature, know if you or a family member is in the room, and can predict when you will wake up and be home based on your previous patterns. All of these features in the name of comfort and energy conservation!
One of my favorite smart devices is my Apple Watch. Not only does it track my daily steps and gives me feedback on how well I slept, it also monitors my heart rate and uploads all of my health metrics into my phone. I can bring it with me when I go swimming and it will track my exercise minutes and share that data with my friends real-time.
On special occasions, it even tells the time.
In recent years, we have seen the rise of smart homes appliances such as smart toasters, frying pans, refrigerators that all connect to the internet. We have so many smart devices we have to assign a device manager to oversee these processes in the form of Alexa and Googleâ€™s Home. How cool and crazy is that!
