Rise of the Machines
What propagated the rise of IoT? Why did all this growth occur recently? There are many factors such as the following:
Cost-effectiveness in mass production of electronics
Cheap processors that help power/connect these devices
Power-frugal engineering to allow devices to last longer/operate with less overhead
Adoption of RFID tags that allow devices to communicate wirelessly
Increased availability of broadband internet and cellular and wireless networking
Adoption of IPv6 (versus IPv4), which provides enough IP addresses for every device in this galaxy
